>What is the primary purpose of grounding in generative AI?
```
To connect the AI's output to verifiable sources of information.
```
>Which techniques can be used to overcome the limitations of foundation model performance?
```
Grounding, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and humans in the loop (HITL).
```
>Which type of foundation model is specifically designed to understand and generate human language?
```
Large language model (LLM)
```
>Why is fine-tuning and customization an important factor when choosing a model?
```
It allows the model to be adapted for specific tasks or domains.
```
>Which type of foundation model would be most suitable for generating photorealistic images from textual descriptions?
```
Diffusion model
```
>What is the primary role of humans in the loop (HITL) in machine learning?
```
To integrate human expertise into the ML process, especially for tasks requiring judgment or context.
