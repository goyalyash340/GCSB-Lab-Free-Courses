>Which of the following is a primary feature of foundation models?
```
Adaptability across a wide range of tasks.
```
>Which of the following defines a foundation model?
```
Large AI models trained on a vast quantity of data, capable of adapting to a variety of tasks.
```
>What is the primary difference between foundation models and traditional AI models?
```
Foundation models are trained on massive amounts of diverse data for various tasks, while traditional models are trained on specific data for a single task.
```
>How do foundation models and prompt engineering work together to create value in generative AI?
```
Foundation models offer a vast knowledge base, and prompt engineering guides the model to use this knowledge in responses.
```
>What is the purpose of a prompt in the context of foundation models?
```
To provide input to the model and trigger an output.
